# Deploying Your Project to Vercel

This guide will walk you through the process of deploying your project to Vercel step by step.

## Prerequisites
- A GitHub account
- A Vercel account (you can sign up at https://vercel.com)
- Your project code pushed to a GitHub repository

## Step 1: Prepare Your Project
1. Make sure your project has a `package.json` file with all necessary dependencies
2. Ensure your project has a proper build script in `package.json`
3. If you have environment variables, prepare a list of them

## Step 2: Sign Up for Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. You can sign up using your GitHub account (recommended) or email
4. Complete the registration process

## Step 3: Deploy Your Project
1. After signing in to Vercel, click "Add New..." button
2. Select "Project" from the dropdown menu
3. Connect your GitHub account if you haven't already
4. Select the repository you want to deploy
5. Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Next.js project

## Step 4: Configure Project Settings
1. In the configuration page, you'll see the following settings:
   - Framework Preset: Should be automatically set to Next.js
   - Build Command: Usually `next build`
   - Output Directory: Usually `.next`
   - Install Command: Usually `npm install` or `yarn install`

2. Environment Variables (if any):
   - Click on "Environment Variables"
   - Add any environment variables your project needs
   - Make sure to add them for all environments (Production, Preview, and Development)

## Step 5: Deploy
1. Click "Deploy"
2. Vercel will start the deployment process
3. You can watch the build logs in real-time
4. Once deployment is complete, you'll get a URL for your deployed site

## Step 6: Post-Deployment
1. Your site will be live at the provided URL
2. You can set up a custom domain in the project settings
3. Each time you push to your main branch, Vercel will automatically redeploy

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Build Failures
- Check the build logs for specific errors
- Ensure all dependencies are properly listed in `package.json`
- Verify that all environment variables are set correctly

### Environment Variables
- Make sure all required environment variables are added in Vercel
- Double-check the values are correct
- Remember that environment variables are case-sensitive

### Custom Domain Setup
1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Click on "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Follow the DNS configuration instructions provided by Vercel

## Best Practices
1. Always test your build locally before deploying
2. Keep your dependencies up to date
3. Use environment variables for sensitive information
4. Set up proper error monitoring
5. Configure proper caching strategies
